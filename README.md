# Spirograph
Some changing over Jacque Supzick spirograph repository

the spirograph contain 4 adjustable variables, each one depicted by a color.
Red = big circle radius
green = small circle radius
pink = position of the pencil along the small circle
orange = speed


by using the left / right buttons we can change the varaible "selected"
by using the up / down button we can increase / decrease the value
by using the central button we can eraze the canvas.

I don't know circuit python and made the change using AI so it might not be the most efficient code.
